\subsection{tdpager}

Sometimes you don't know what you're even searching for when you received some dumps and someone says ``Hey, what was the problem back then?''.
In such cases you'd shrink the dumps by filtering out some JVM internal dumps or so.
Maybe tdlocks doesn't give you more hints about a lock as bottleneck.
But what now?
You'd like to take a look at the threads.
But in XML? Urgh...

The right tool is tdpager then.
It's a simple pager which allows you to browse thread by thread through all dumps.
You navigate through threads using \inlineCode{n} and \inlineCode{b} (next and previous/before) or the left and right arrow keys.
The keys \inlineCode{t} and \inlineCode{T} switch to the next and previous dump.
If you want to see how a thread looks in other dumps, just stick it by pressing \inlineCode{s}.
Now you can navigation through the dumps and see how the sticked thread looks like in other dumps.
If a thread is not found in a dump, the dump is simply skipped.
Using \inlineCode{u} you unstick a sticked thread.

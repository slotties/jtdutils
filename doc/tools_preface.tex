\section{Tools}

\subsection{Introduction}

The jtdutils contain three types of tools:
\begin{description}
\item[Parsers] are used to parse JVM specific thread dumps and transform it into the jtdutils dump format.
\item[Filters] are used to filter threads and even single dumps from a whole load of thread dumps.
\item[Analysts] are used for analysing the dumps. 
\end{description}

The tdstrip tool is used for parsing thread dumps and generating our own dump format.
The tools tdfilter and tdgrep are used for filtering.
All other tools are analytic tools.

All tools except parsers have to accept either a jtdutils-dump from standard in (stdin) or from a real file.
No tool writes anything on the harddisk, everything happens in memory to achieve high performance.
Because of performance reasons I try to optimize tools as good as possible.
